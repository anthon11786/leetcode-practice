"""
Describe an algorithm to compute the longest incresing subsequence 
of an array of numbers in o(n logn) time

Examples:
Input: arr[] = {3, 10, 2, 1, 20}
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is 3, 10, 20

Input: arr[] = {3, 2}
Output:1
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequences are {3} and {2}
